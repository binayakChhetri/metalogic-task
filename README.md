# Design decisions

# Color Scheme
- Maintained MetaLogic's brand colors with red as the primary accent color
- Incorporated a neutral palette (whites, grays) as the foundation for content sections
- Added complementary colors for icons and section highlights to create visual interest

# Typography
- Selected a clean, Roboto font for optimal readability across devices
- Created clear typographic hierarchy with distinct sizes for headings, subheadings, and body text
- Maintained consistent text alignment patterns (centered for headings, left-aligned for content)

# Responsive Design
- Built with a mobile-first approach using Tailwind's responsive utility classes
- Implemented column stacking for smaller screens and grid layouts for larger displays
- Created touch-friendly navigation and buttons for mobile users

# Component Design
- Designed consistent card patterns with subtle shadows and hover effects
- Used rounded corners for buttons and containers to match modern UI expectations
- Created visual interest through iconography that communicates concepts quickly
